Unit Testing 

Testing Frameworks for testing such as Jasmine or Mocha 

We will use Mocha (npm install - g mocha to install globally)

run 'mocha' in terminal -- it looks for a test directory

TDD - Test Driven Development 
write the test first, watch it fail, and then make our code pass

we can use Chai  : npm install chai -- save-dev    under dev dependencies 
Chai will check our assertion values 

Sometimes a function is async and needs more time for task to complete - we can write a function that loads a webpage in Mocha  (ex in tools-spec.js)
