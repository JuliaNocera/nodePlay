Istanbul -- code coverage report -- tells us how many lines of code we are actually testing

to generate type : 
	istanbul cover _mocha      in terminal

	 this runs tests and shows results as well as statments, branches, functions, and lines 
	 once generated we will see a coverage folder --> lcov-report --> index.html which gives you your code coverage support (it will show you where your tests are and the coverage)

	 Explore the index.html file to get more info on what you are and aren't testing in a given folder and file
