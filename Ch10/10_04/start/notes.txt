servers aren't the only dependencies that are mockable 

any dependency can be mocked 
	
when we test module or (f) that is under test as SUT (System Under Test) others below that are called
collaborators (some of these might be under development so we have to mock -- we want to test with mock data so we don't accidently rewrite our real data)
