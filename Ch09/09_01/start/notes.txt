Web sockets : 

true 2-way connection between client and server - they use their own TCP server

Polling : when the browser make a GET request to the server to see if info has changed 
Long Polling : leave GET req open and timeout if nothing changes (more efficient polling)
Web Sockets: client can connect to server and leave a two way server - client sends data that is broadcasted to any open client
	They use their own protocol so it sucks to set from scratch -- YAY node modules! we don't need to
